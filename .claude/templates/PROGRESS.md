## How to Use This Document

1. **Starting work**: Use `/next-feature` to pick the next task group
2. **During work**: Check off items as they're completed
3. **Completing work**: Use `/review-merge` to review and update progress
4. **Tracking**: Update the Summary table when phase progress changes

### Task States

- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[x]` - Completed

### Best Practices

- Complete all items in a feature group before moving to the next
- Update "Last Updated" date when making changes
- Add notes for non-obvious completions
- Keep the Completed Work table updated for reference
